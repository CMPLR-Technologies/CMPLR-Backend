# Hopefully it was you 

If it wasn’t, here’s what to do:

1. Change your password. Don’t delay. If you’re using the same password in other places, you’re going to want to change them all. 

2. Contact our Support team. 
If it was you, no need to worry. You opted to get these emails whenever there’s new login or password activity on your account, so that’s why we’re telling you all this.

Thanks,<br>
